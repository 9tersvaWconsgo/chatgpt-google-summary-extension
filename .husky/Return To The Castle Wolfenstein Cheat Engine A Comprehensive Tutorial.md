One way to do that is to use Cheat Engine, a software that allows you to modify the memory of any running process on your computer. Cheat Engine can help you change various aspects of the game, such as your health, ammo, weapons, enemies, and more. In this article, we will show you how to use Cheat Engine in Return To The Castle Wolfenstein.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Cheat Engine
 
The first thing you need to do is to download and install Cheat Engine on your computer. You can get it from [the official website](https://www.cheatengine.org/). Follow the instructions on the website to install it properly.
 
## Step 2: Launch Return To The Castle Wolfenstein
 
The next thing you need to do is to launch Return To The Castle Wolfenstein on your computer. You can do this by using the shortcut on your desktop or by finding the game folder and running the executable file. Make sure you launch the game in single-player mode, as using Cheat Engine in multiplayer mode may get you banned.
 
## Step 3: Enable Cheats in the Game
 
Before you can use Cheat Engine, you need to enable cheats in the game. To do this, you need to edit the shortcut to the game by adding "set sv\_cheats 1" to the end of the target field[^1^]. For example, it should look like this:
 `"C:\Program Files\Return to Castle Wolfenstein\WolfSP.exe" +set sv_cheats 1` 
Notice that there are three spaces between the last " and the + in the Windows 2000 shortcut[^1^]. After you have done this, launch the game using the modified shortcut. You should see a message saying "Cheats are enabled" in the console window.
 
## Step 4: Open Cheat Engine and Select the Game Process
 
Now that you have enabled cheats in the game, you can open Cheat Engine on your computer. You should see a window like this:

## Step 5: Use Cheat Engine to Modify Values
 
Now comes the fun part. You can use Cheat Engine to modify various values in the game, such as your health, ammo, weapons, enemies, and more. To do this, you need to follow these steps:
